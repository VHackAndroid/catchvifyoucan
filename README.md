App
---

During the hackathon we created the CatchVifYouCan app for
[Android][8]. CatchVifYouCan aims to bring health and (European) Culture into
the minds of its users.

CatchVifYouCan mixes [Scotland Yard][9], [Pac-Man][10] and the [game
of Tag][11] in an hightech innovative gameplay, combining the
capabillities of a modern Android device with the culture of European
cities.
CatchVifYouCan transforms cities into urban playground offering a
unique oppertunity to see a city in a new light and meeting
interesting new people along the way.
